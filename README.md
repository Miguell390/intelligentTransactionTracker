##  Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your machine:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (which includes npm)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- A [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas) account for the database.

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-github-username/your-repo-name.git
    cd your-repo-name
    ```

2.  **Install Backend Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    cd backend
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Install Frontend Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    cd ../frontend
    npm install
    ```

4.  **Set Up Environment Variables:**
    - In the `backend` folder, create a new file named `.env`.
    - You will need two variables: your MongoDB Connection String and your Google Gemini API Key.
    - Add them to the `.env` file like this:
      ```
      MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
      GEMINI_API_KEY=your_google_gemini_api_key
      ```
    - **Important:** Your `.env` file should be listed in your `.gitignore` file to keep your keys secret!

### Running the Application

You will need to run the frontend and backend servers in two separate terminals.

1.  **Run the Backend Server:**
    *(In the `backend` directory)*
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    Your server should now be running on `http://localhost:5001`.

2.  **Run the Frontend Application:**
    *(In the `frontend` directory)*
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
    Your React application should now be running and open automatically on `http://localhost:3000`
